# Paid Family Leave Dashboard  

## Overview  
This project explores the impact of Paid Family Leave (PFL) policies on maternal and infant health outcomes in the United States.  
It was created as my first data analytics project after completing a Data Analytics Bootcamp.  

## Datasets Used  
- **CDC WONDER Natality Data** â†’ analyzed rates of low birthweight and preterm births by PFL vs. non-PFL states  
- **CDC BRFSS (2011â€“2023)** â†’ built a maternal health proxy comparing mental/physical health days (`MENTHLTH`, `POORHLTH`) in women aged 18â€“44 vs. women 45+ (files were too large for upload)
- **Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)** â†’ added state-level policy and workforce context  
- *(Future Work)* **PRAMS Survey** (maternal health & experiences) â†’ not available for this project, but planned for a future version  

## Tools & Skills  
- **Python** â†’ data cleaning and preparation  
- **Tableau Desktop & Tableau Public** â†’ visualization and dashboard design  
- **Excel** â†’ initial exploration and validation  

## Key Questions  
1. Do PFL states have lower rates of preterm births and low birthweight compared to non-PFL states?  
2. How does maternal mental/physical health differ by PFL policy status?  
3. What patterns emerge when comparing maternal-aged women (18â€“44) vs. older women (45+)?

## Insights  
- Maternal-aged women in experience more poor mental health days compared to women aged 45+.
- PFL states generally showed lower rates of preterm births and low birthweight.  
- Limitations included lack of access to PRAMS data for maternal health and experience.  

## Future Improvements  
- Incorporate PRAMS survey data when available  
- Refine statistical comparisons (e.g., confidence intervals, regression analysis)  
- Explore industry-specific PFL access (retail, hospitality, tech, etc.)
